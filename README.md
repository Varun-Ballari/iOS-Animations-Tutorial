# Tutorial over iOS Animations

Tutorial I taught for iOS Club at Georgia Tech on March 14th, 2017.

### About
- This is an iOS app that is a login screen, which was used to teach UIView and Core Animations.
- Covers `UIView.Animate()` with delays and  and `CABasicAnimation`. 
- It also incorporats `Lottie`, an animation framework built by Airbb that allows users to create animations on Adobe After Effects and put them into iOS projects.
